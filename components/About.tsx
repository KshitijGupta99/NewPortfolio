          I&rsquo;m a 3rd-year Computer Science student at IIIT Sonepat, driven by a passion for full-stack web development and building intuitive, impactful digital experiences. With strong hands-on experience in the MERN stack and Next.js, I specialize in transforming ideas into seamless, scalable applications with a modern UI/UX focus.
          
          Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve developed projects like real-time chat platforms, contact managers, and crypto dashboardsâ€”handling both frontend finesse and backend logic. I thrive in roles that allow me to work across the stack and learn continuously.
          
          I&rsquo;m currently the PR Lead at GDG IIIT Sonepat and Content Lead at AlgoZenith, where I actively contribute to organizing tech events and content creation, enhancing both communication and leadership skills. I also dedicate time to solving DSA problems, studying system design, and collaborating in hackathons.
          
          My goal is to develop software that not only works but delights. I enjoy collaborating with enthusiastic minds to build products that make a difference and reflect craftsmanship at every level.
